## Kepler Space Telescope

For decades, humans have dreamed about traveling across vast space and living on other planets. Although we can see as much as 5000 stars with naked eyes<sup>[1]</sup>, planets are much smaller, and they hide in the light of their stars.

To search habitable exoplanets, NASA lunched the Kepler space telescope at Cape Canaveral, March 6, 2009<sup>[2]</sup>. Armed with a photometer<sup>[3]</sup>, it was the first of its kind. Behind the 0.95-meter aperture was 42 charged coupled devices (CCD) with a combined resolution over 94.6 megapixels<sup>[3]</sup>. The CCDs measured brightness of all the stars in its field of view, and recorded pixels of stars brighter than R magnitude of 16<sup>[3]</sup>. When a transit event (a planet crossed in front of a star) occurred, the brightness of the star would drop due to the planet blocking it<sup>[6]</sup>. With this data, scientists could deduce many information about the planets and their star systems<sup>[4]</sup>.

The sole mission of the Kepler spacecraft was to identify and validate planet candidates that are earth-like, terrestrial and in the habitable zone where liquid water might exist<sup>[4]</sup>. Before its retirement in 2018, Kepler observed 530,506 stars and discovered far more planets than scientists estimated<sup>[5]</sup>.

When Kepler telescope was operational, I remembered it was like discovering new planets every other day. News about possible habitable worlds were frequent, I thought moving to Kepler-22b was in the near future. Even though, better and newer spacecrafts are out there now finding planets and systems, the feeling is not the same. I would like to share the result of this inspiring mission.

## Kepler Exoplanet Search Results

The data set contains 9564 entries of Kepler object of interest (KOI). A KOI is an object that exhibited at least one transit-like event<sup>[7]</sup>. Each entry has data such as the KOI's ID, name, Kepler name if it is a confirmed planet, and data collected by the Kepler space telescope.

The data set is provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The data was collected by NASA's Kepler space telescope from 2009 to 2013 during its main mission and from 2014 to 2018 during its "K2" extended mission. After the data was collected, further investigations and analyses were conducted by scientists at NASA. Planets that passed validation were given Kepler names (Kepler-xxx) and candidate statuses.

Because some data processes are still ongoing, and space discoveries never stop, the data set could evolve over time. The data set used was accessed in February 11, 2021. For most accurate and current number of discovered exoplanets, please refer to NASA website.
